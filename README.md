# Cyndx Data Engineering Challenge
1. Find the `company_contacts.csv` file in this repo. Clean the `phone` column from this file to a consistent display value.
2. Connect to the following PostgreSQL database instance with the following credentials:
  - Host: data-eng-challenge.cyndx.io
  - Database: test
  - User: de_test_user
  - Password: cofDen-fuzhu2-moqreq
3. Create a new table in the `test` database called `solution` where name is your first name.
4. Merge the `companies` table in the `test` database with the CSV file on their common field, putting the resultant data in the `solution` table. Note: this may require normalization from one or both data sources.
